# FrontendJwtAuthentification

## Requirements
+ Installed with yarn 1.22.19 under windows 10
+ node v16.15.1
+ angular-cli 14.0.4

## Build
Start by installing all build dependencies with `$ yarn install` or `$ npm install`.
Then we can run `$ ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
It is possible to write the build artifacts to differently named folder by adding the ng build flag `--output-path`. Example: 
```
ng build --output-path docs --base-href /frontend_jwt_authentification/ 
```
This might be needed to deploy your project on github pages.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The development server is a proprietory web server that is implemented by the angular framework.
