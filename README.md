# Tutorials
This repository is created in order to store the code, that I have (and will) develop in order to familiarize myself with new librarys, technologies and datastructures/algorithms. Therefore, it is _not_ a project!

All subfolders contain a README.md where the main takeaways from the tutorials are written down, as well as the ressources that I used to do the tutorials. 

By doing this, this repository might give someone a start for investigating the covered topics of the tutorials and see might some additional coding examples that can help build up a better understanding.
